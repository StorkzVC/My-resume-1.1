<h2>About Myself</h2>
<p>My Name is Veer Chourasia and I am 13 and rising into 8th grade. I am a 
    passionate learner and a very good listener. I am a student at Lyfkin Road Middle 
    School, I love to be outdoors and have a place in my heart for all nature. 
    I am a very kind and honest person that knows how to have fun and make people feel better.
    Something very special about me is that I am a left handed person and I react very differently than other people.
    I am very patient with other people and I dont leave them out because of theier differences.
    I have been learning coding for around 6 months now and I think that Ive grown good at it.
